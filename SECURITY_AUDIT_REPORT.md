# Security Audit Report - Secrets Cleanup
**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Status**: RESOLVED - Immediate Action Required

## Executive Summary

A security incident was identified where real AWS credentials and API keys were exposed in environment files and push logs. All exposed secrets have been sanitized from the working directory, but **CRITICAL ACTION IS REQUIRED** to rotate all compromised credentials.

---

## üö® EXPOSED CREDENTIALS (MUST BE ROTATED IMMEDIATELY)

### 1. AWS Credentials
- **AWS Access Key ID**: `AKIA***************` [REDACTED]
- **AWS Secret Access Key**: `******************` [REDACTED]
- **Location**: `./.env:6-7` (now sanitized)
- **Action**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **ROTATE IMMEDIATELY via AWS IAM Console**

### 2. DeepSeek API Key
- **API Key**: `sk-***********************` [REDACTED]
- **Location**: `./.env:2` (now sanitized)
- **Action**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **REGENERATE in DeepSeek dashboard**

### 3. AWS Cognito Configuration
- **User Pool ID**: `us-east-1_*********` [REDACTED]
- **Client ID**: `*********************` [REDACTED]
- **Location**: `./.env:10-11` (now sanitized)
- **Risk**: Medium (public identifiers, but should be monitored)

### 4. GitHub Personal Access Token
- **Token**: `ghp_***********************` [REDACTED]
- **Location**: `.tmp/push-logs/` (now deleted)
- **Action**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **REVOKE at https://github.com/settings/tokens**
- **Note**: Now stored securely in `scripts/credentials/github.sh` (gitignored)

### 5. JWT & Session Secrets
- **JWT Secret**: `***********************************` [REDACTED]
- **Session Secret**: `*****************************` [REDACTED]
- **Location**: `server/.env:28,30` (template values, low risk)
- **Action**: Generate new secrets for production

---

## ‚úÖ Remediation Actions Completed

### 1. Sanitized Environment Files
- **`./.env`** - Replaced all real credentials with placeholders
- **`./server/.env`** - Already contained placeholder values
- **`./client/.env`** - Verified safe (not flagged in scan)

### 2. Deleted Sensitive Artifacts
- Removed `.tmp/push-logs/` directory containing GitHub token traces
- Deleted `final_scan.txt` containing secret references

### 3. Verified Backup Security
- **`.secrets-backup/.env.20251018-082735`** - Contains only placeholders (SAFE)
- **`.secrets-backup/.env.local.20251018-082735`** - Contains placeholder values (SAFE)

### 4. Enhanced .gitignore
Added comprehensive exclusions:
```gitignore
# Credentials system - NEVER COMMIT
scripts/credentials/
scripts/*.env
*.secret

# temp push logs
push_*log
.tmp/
```

---

## üìã Current State of Files

### Safe Files (Sanitized/Placeholder Values)
- ‚úÖ `./.env` - Sanitized with placeholders
- ‚úÖ `./server/.env` - Template with placeholders
- ‚úÖ `./client/.env` - Safe (if exists)
- ‚úÖ `./.env.example` - Template file
- ‚úÖ `./client/.env.example` - Template file
- ‚úÖ `./server/.env.example` - Template file

### Secure Credential Storage (Gitignored)
- ‚úÖ `scripts/credentials/github.sh` - GitHub credentials (600 permissions)
- ‚úÖ `scripts/launch_credentials.sh` - Master credential loader (700 permissions)

### Deleted Files
- ‚ùå `.tmp/push-logs/` - Completely removed
- ‚ùå `final_scan.txt` - Deleted

## üîê Immediate Action Checklist

### Step 1: Rotate AWS Credentials (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Go to AWS IAM Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/
2. Navigate to "Users" ‚Üí Find your user
3. Go to "Security credentials" tab
4. Click "Make inactive" on the exposed key (starts with AKIA***)
5. Create new access key
6. Update `scripts/credentials/aws.sh` (create this file)
7. Delete the old access key from AWS

### Step 2: Revoke GitHub Token (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Find the exposed token (starts with ghp_***)
3. Click "Delete" or "Revoke"
4. Generate new token with same scopes
5. Update `scripts/credentials/github.sh` with new token

### Step 3: Regenerate DeepSeek API Key (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Log into DeepSeek dashboard
2. Revoke the exposed key (starts with sk-***)
3. Generate new API key
4. Update `.env` or create `scripts/credentials/deepseek.sh`

### Step 4: Monitor AWS Account (RECOMMENDED)
1. Check AWS CloudTrail for any unauthorized access
2. Review recent API calls from the exposed key
3. Check for any unexpected EC2 instances or S3 buckets
4. Set up AWS billing alerts

### Step 5: Generate New Application Secrets (RECOMMENDED)
For production deployments, generate new:
- JWT_SECRET (use `openssl rand -hex 64`)
- SESSION_SECRET (use `openssl rand -hex 32`)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures Implemented

### 1. Credential Management System
Created organized credential storage:
```
scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credentials/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Documentation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ github.sh          # GitHub credentials (gitignored)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ launch_credentials.sh  # Master loader
```

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Updated main `README.md` with credential loading instructions
- Created `.claude/project-context.md` for AI agent awareness
- Added `scripts/credentials/README.md` for team guidance

### 3. Security Automation
- Created `scripts/check_credentials.sh` to verify credentials are loaded
- Set file permissions: 600 for credentials, 700 for launchers

### 4. Git Protection
Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent future leaks:
- All `scripts/credentials/` files
- All `.env*` files recursively
- Backup directories
- Push logs and temp files

---

## üìä Impact Assessment

### Files Exposed in Git History
**UNKNOWN** - Need to check if real credentials were ever committed to git.

To check:
```bash
git log --all --full-history -- ".env"
git log --all --full-history -- "server/.env"
```

If secrets were committed, you'll need to:
1. Use BFG Repo-Cleaner or `git filter-branch`
2. Force push to rewrite history
3. Notify all team members to re-clone

### Potential Exposure Window
- **Start**: Unknown (depends on when credentials were first added)
- **End**: October 18, 2025, 08:27 AM (cleanup completed)

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Rotate AWS credentials
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Revoke and regenerate GitHub token
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Regenerate DeepSeek API key

### Short-term (This Week)
4. Check git history for committed secrets
5. Monitor AWS CloudTrail for suspicious activity
6. Review GitHub access logs

### Long-term (This Month)
7. Implement AWS Secrets Manager for production
8. Set up secret rotation policies
9. Add pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets
10. Conduct team security training

## üìù Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. Real credentials stored in `.env` files in working directory
2. Push logs captured and stored credential references
3. Multiple duplicate backups created with cp -f overwrites

### What Went Right
1. Secrets detected before production deployment
2. Comprehensive cleanup executed
3. New credential management system established
4. Documentation created for future prevention
