# Credential Migration - Complete âœ…

**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Status**: âœ… **MIGRATION SUCCESSFUL**

---

## What Was Done

Successfully migrated from insecure credential storage to a secure, gitignored system.

### Files Created

1. **`scripts/credentials/local.sh`** (gitignored, 600 permissions)
   - Contains all real secrets
   - Never committed to git
   - Secure file permissions

2. **`scripts/credentials/github.sh.example`** (safe template)
   - Placeholder values only
   - Safe to commit
   - Template for team members

3. **`URGENT_TOKEN_ROTATION.md`**
   - Instructions to rotate GitHub token
   - Must be completed immediately

### Files Modified

1. **`.gitignore`**
   - Now properly excludes all `.sh` files in `scripts/credentials/`
   - Allows `.example` files to be committed

2. **`scripts/launch_credentials.sh`**
   - Updated to source `local.sh` first
   - Fallback to legacy `github.sh` for compatibility

3. **`README.md`**
   - Updated Quick Start instructions
   - Added credential setup documentation

4. **`scripts/credentials/README.md`**
   - Complete setup guide
   - Daily usage instructions

### Files Deleted

1. **`scripts/credentials/github.sh`**
   - Contained exposed token
   - Replaced by `local.sh`

---

## Current State

### Secure
- âœ… `local.sh` contains real secrets (gitignored)
- âœ… `local.sh` has 600 permissions (secure)
- âœ… No secrets in tracked files
- âœ… Safe to commit
- âœ… Safe to push

### Files That Will Be Committed
```
M  .gitignore
M  README.md
M  bootstrap_scaffold.sh
??  scripts/credentials/github.sh.example
??  scripts/credentials/README.md
??  scripts/launch_credentials.sh
```

### Files That Won't Be Committed (Gitignored)
```
scripts/credentials/local.sh  (contains real secrets)
```

---

## How to Use

### First Time Setup (Already Done)
```bash
# You already have local.sh with your secrets
ls -l scripts/credentials/local.sh
# -rw-------  (600 permissions - secure!)
```

### Daily Usage
```bash
# Load credentials before git operations
source scripts/launch_credentials.sh

# Or load directly
source scripts/credentials/local.sh

# Then use git normally
git status
git push
```

## Next Steps (CRITICAL)

### 1. Rotate GitHub Token (DO THIS NOW)

See `URGENT_TOKEN_ROTATION.md` for detailed steps.

**Quick Steps:**
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Revoke token ending in `...09z5We`
3. Generate new token
4. Update `scripts/credentials/local.sh`
5. Test with `source scripts/credentials/local.sh && git fetch`

### 2. Add Other Credentials to local.sh

Edit `scripts/credentials/local.sh` to add:
- AWS credentials
- DeepSeek API key
- Other service credentials

Template already included in the file!

### 3. Commit the Changes

Once everything looks good:
```bash
git add .gitignore README.md bootstrap_scaffold.sh
git add scripts/credentials/github.sh.example
git add scripts/credentials/README.md
git add scripts/launch_credentials.sh

git commit -m "feat: migrate to secure credential management system

- Add local.sh for real secrets (gitignored)
- Add github.sh.example as template
- Update .gitignore to protect credentials
- Update documentation with new workflow

## Verification

### Scan Results
```
âœ…âœ…âœ…  ALL CHECKS PASSED âœ…âœ…âœ…
âœ… Repository is CLEAN
âœ… SAFE TO COMMIT
âœ… SAFE TO PUSH
```

### Gitignore Test
```bash
git check-ignore scripts/credentials/local.sh
# scripts/credentials/local.sh  âœ… (gitignored)

git check-ignore scripts/credentials/github.sh.example
# (no output) âœ… (can be committed)
```

## For Team Members

When onboarding new team members:

1. They clone the repo
2. They run: `cp scripts/credentials/github.sh.example scripts/credentials/local.sh`
3. They edit `local.sh` with their own credentials
4. They run: `source scripts/launch_credentials.sh`
5. Done!
